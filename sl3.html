<h2>Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In <a href="intro.html#intro">Chapter 1</a>, we introduced the <a href="#roadmap"><em>Roadmap for Targeted
Learning</em></a> as a general template to translate real-world data
applications into formal statistical estimation problems. The first steps of
this roadmap define the <em>statistical estimation problem</em>, which establish</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Data as a random variable, or equivalently, a realization of a
particular experiment/study.</li>
<li>A statistical model as the set of possible probability distributions that
could have given rise to the observed data. We could know, for example, that
the observations are independent and identically distributed.</li>
<li>A translation of the scientific question, which is often causal, into a
target estimand.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that if the estimand is causal, step 3 also requires establishing
identifiability of the estimand from the observed data, under possible
non-testable assumptions that may not necessarily be reasonable. Still, the
target quantity does have a valid statistical interpretation. See <a href="intro.html#causal">causal target
parameters</a> for more detail on causal models and identifiability.</p>
<p>Now that we have defined the statistical estimation problem, we are ready to
construct the TMLE; an asymptotically linear and efficient substitution
estimator of this estimand. The first step in this estimation procedure
is an initial estimate of the data-generating distribution, or the relevant part
of this distribution that is needed to evaluate the target parameter. For this
initial estimation, we use the Super Learner (SL) <span class="citation">(van der Laan, Polley, and Hubbard <a href="references.html#ref-vdl2007super" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The SL provides an important step in creating a robust estimator. It is a loss-
function- based tool that uses cross-validation to obtain the best prediction of
our target parameter, based on a weighted average of a library of machine
learning algorithms. The library of machine learning algorithms consists of
functions (“learners” in the <code>sl3</code> nomenclature) that we think might be
consistent with the true data-generating distribution. By “consistent with the
true data-generating distribution”, we mean that the algorithms selected should
not violate subject-matter knowledge about the experiment that generated the
data. Also, the library should contain a diversity of algorithms that range from
parametric regression models to multi-step algorithms involving screening
covariates, penalizations, optimizing tuning parameters, etc.</p>
<p>The ensembling of the collection of algorithms with weights (metalearning) has
been shown to be adaptive and robust, even in small samples <span class="citation">(Polley and van der Laan <a href="references.html#ref-polley2010super" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>.
The SL is proven to perform asymptotically as well as the best possible
prediction algorithm in the library <span class="citation">(van der Laan and Dudoit <a href="references.html#ref-vdl2003unified" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>; Van der Vaart, Dudoit, and Laan <a href="references.html#ref-vaart2006oracle" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>.</p>

<ul>
<li>A common task in data analysis is prediction — using the observed data to
learn a function, which can be used to map new input variables into a
predicted outcome.
<!--
  Oftentimes, the scientific question of interest translates to a statistical
  question that requires (causal) effect estimation. Even in these scenarios,
  where prediction is not in the forefront, there are Often prediction steps
  embedded in the procedure.
  --->
</li>
<li>For some data, algorithms that can model a complex function are necessary to
adequately model the data. For other data, a main terms regression model might
fit the data quite well.</li>
<li>The Super Learner (SL), an ensemble learner, solves this issue, by allowing a
combination of algorithms from the simplest (intercept-only) to most complex
(neural nets, random forests, SVM, etc).</li>
<li>It works by using cross-validation in a manner that provides asymptotic
guarantees that the resulting fit will be as good as possible, given the
learners provided.</li>

<h3>Summary of Super Learner’s Foundations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#summary-of-super-learners-foundations"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We use a <em>loss function</em> <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> to assign a measure of performance to each
learner <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> when applied to the data <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, and subsequently compare
performance across the learners. More generally, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> maps every
<span class="math inline">\(\psi \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(L(\psi) : (O) \mapsto L(\psi)(O)\)</span>. We use the terms
“learner”, “algorithm”, and “estimator” interchangeably.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is important to recall that <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\psi}\)</span> is an estimator of <span class="math inline">\(\psi_0\)</span>,
the unknown and true parameter value under <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>.</li>
<li>A valid loss function will have expectation (risk) that is minimized at
the true value of the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\psi_0\)</span>. Thus, minimizing the expected
loss will bring an estimator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\psi}\)</span> closer to the true <span class="math inline">\(\psi_0\)</span>.</li>
<li>For example, say we observe a learning data set <span class="math inline">\(O_i=(Y_i,X_i)\)</span>, of
<span class="math inline">\(i=1, \ldots, n\)</span> independent and identically distributed observations,
where <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> is a continuous outcome of interest, <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> is a set of
covariates. Also, let our objective be to estimate the function
<span class="math inline">\(\psi_0: X \mapsto \psi_0(X) = \mathbb{E}_0(Y \mid X)\)</span>, which is the
conditional mean outcome given covariates. This function can be expressed
as the minimizer of the expected squared error loss:
<span class="math inline">\(\psi_0 = \text{argmin}_{\psi} \mathbb{E}[L(O,\psi(X))]\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(L(O,\psi(X)) = (Y − \psi(X))^2\)</span>.</li>
<li>We estimate the loss by substituting the empirical distribution of the
data <span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span> for the true and unknown distribution of the observed data
<span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>.</li>
<li>Also, we can use the cross-validated risk to empirically determine the
relative performance of an estimator (i.e., a candidate learner), and
perhaps how it’s performance compares to other estimators.</li>
<li>Once we have tested different estimators on actual data and looked at the
performance (e.g., MSE of predictions across all learners), we can see
which algorithm (or weighted combination) has the lowest risk, and thus
is closest to the true <span class="math inline">\(\psi_0\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The <em>cross-validated empirical risk</em> of an algorithm is defined as the
empirical mean over a validation sample of the loss of the algorithm fitted
on the training sample, averaged across the splits of the data.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>discrete Super Learner</em>, or <em>cross-validation selector</em>, is the algorithm
in the library that minimizes the cross-validated empirical risk.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>continuous/ensemble Super Learner</em>, often referred to as <em>Super Learner</em>
is a weighted average of the library of algorithms, where the weights are
chosen to minimize the cross-validated empirical risk of the library.

combination) has been shown to improve upon the discrete Super Learner

<!--
The *oracle results* prove that, if the number of algorithms in the library are
polynomial in sample size, then the cross-validation selector (i.e., discrete
Super Learner) (1) is equivalent with the oracle selector asymptotically (based
on sample of size of training samples), or (2) achieves the parametric rate
(log $n/n$) for convergence with respect to the loss-based dissimilarity (risk)
between a candidate estimate $\psi$ and the true parameter value $\psi_0$.

<h3>1. Define the machine learning task<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#define-the-machine-learning-task"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>To define the machine learning <code>task</code> (predict weight-for-height Z-score
<code>whz</code> using the available covariate data), we need to create an <code>sl3_Task</code>
object.</p>
<p>The <code>sl3_Task</code> keeps track of the roles the variables play in the machine
learning problem, the data, and any metadata (e.g., observational-level
weights, IDs, offset).</p>
<p>Also, if we had missing outcomes, we would need to set <code>drop_missing_outcome = TRUE</code> when we create the task. In the next analysis, with the <a href="#ist">IST stroke trial
data</a>, we do have a missing outcome. In the following chapter, we need to
estimate this missingness mechanism; which is the conditional probably that
the outcome is observed, given the history (i.e., variables that were measured
before the missingness). Estimating the missingness mechanism requires learning
a prediction function that outputs the predicted probability that a unit
is missing, given their history.</p>

<span class="co">#&gt; Missing covariate data detected: imputing covariates.</span></code></pre></div>
<p><em>This warning is important.</em> The task just imputed missing covariates for us.
Specifically, for each covariate column with missing values, <code>sl3</code> uses the
median to impute missing continuous covariates, and the mode to impute binary
and categorical covariates.</p>
<p>Also, for each covariate column with missing values, <code>sl3</code> adds an additional
column indicating whether or not the value was imputed, which is particularly
handy when the missingness in the data might be informative.</p>
<p>Also, notice that we did not specify the number of folds, or the loss function
in the task. The default cross-validation scheme is V-fold, with <span class="math inline">\(V=10\)</span> number
of folds.</p>

to be fit sequentially, where the fit from one learner is used to define the
task for the next learner. We need to create a <code>Pipeline</code> with the interaction
defining learner and another learner that incorporate these terms when fitting
a model. Let’s create a learner pipeline that will fit a linear model with the

<p>We can also stack the learners by first creating a vector, and then
instantiating the stack. I prefer this method, since it easily allows us to
modify the names of the learners.</p>

<p>We’re jumping ahead a bit, but let’s check something out quickly. It’s
straightforward, and just one more step, to set up this stack such that
all of the learners will train in a cross-validated manner.</p>

<h4>Screening Algorithms for Feature Selection<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#screening-algorithms-for-feature-selection"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>We can optionally select a subset of available covariates and pass only
those variables to the modeling algorithm. The current set of learners that
can be used for prescreening covariates is included below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Lrnr_screener_importance</code> selects <code>num_screen</code> (default = 5) covariates
based on the variable importance ranking provided by the <code>learner</code>. Any
learner with an importance method can be used in <code>Lrnr_screener_importance</code>;
and this currently includes <code>Lrnr_ranger</code>, <code>Lrnr_randomForest</code>, and
<code>Lrnr_xgboost</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>Lrnr_screener_coefs</code>, which provides screening of covariates based on the
magnitude of their estimated coefficients in a (possibly regularized) GLM.
The <code>threshold</code> (default = 1e-3) defines the minimum absolute size of the
coefficients, and thus covariates, to be kept. Also, a <code>max_retain</code> argument
can be optionally provided to restrict the number of selected covariates to be
no more than <code>max_retain</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>Lrnr_screener_correlation</code> provides covariate screening procedures by
running a test of correlation (Pearson default), and then selecting the (1)
top ranked variables (default), or (2) the variables with a pvalue lower than
some pre-specified threshold.</li>
<li>
<code>Lrnr_screener_augment</code> augments a set of screened covariates with additional
covariates that should be included by default, even if the screener did not
select them. An example of how to use this screener is included below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s consider screening covariates based on their <code>randomForest</code> variable
importance ranking (ordered by mean decrease in accuracy). To select the top
5 most important covariates according to this ranking, we can combine
<code>Lrnr_screener_importance</code> with <code>Lrnr_ranger</code> (limiting the number of trees by
setting <code>ntree = 20</code>).</p>
<p>Hang on! Before you think it – we will confess: Bob Ross and us both know that
20 trees makes for a lonely forest, and we shouldn’t consider it, but these are
the sacrifices we make for this chapter to be built in time!</p>

<p>Selecting covariates with non-zero lasso coefficients is quite common. Let’s
construct <code>Lrnr_screener_coefs</code> screener that does just that, and test it
out.</p>

<p>To pipe only the selected covariates to the modeling algorithm, we need to
make a <code>Pipeline</code>, similar to the one we built for the regression model with
interaction terms.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb25"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>Now, these learners will be preceded by a screening step.</p>
<p>We also consider the original <code>stack</code>, to compare how the feature selection
methods perform in comparison to the methods without feature selection.</p>
<p>Analogous to what we have seen before, we have to stack the pipeline and
original <code>stack</code> together, so we may use them as base learners in our super
learner.</p>

<p>We will use the <a href="https://tlverse.org/sl3/reference/default_metalearner.html">default
metalearner</a>,
which uses
<a href="https://tlverse.org/sl3/reference/Lrnr_solnp.html"><code>Lrnr_solnp</code></a> to
provide fitting procedures for a pairing of <a href="https://tlverse.org/sl3/reference/loss_functions.html">loss

function</a>. This
default metalearner selects a loss and metalearner pairing based on the outcome
type. Note that any learner can be used as a metalearner.</p>
<p>Now that we have made a diverse stack of base learners, we are ready to make the
SL. The SL algorithm fits a metalearner on the validation set
predictions/losses across all folds.</p>

<p>We can also use <code>Lrnr_cv</code> to build a SL, cross-validate a stack of
learners to compare performance of the learners in the stack, or cross-validate
any single learner (see “Cross-validation” section of this <a href="https://tlverse.org/sl3/articles/intro_sl3.html"><code>sl3</code>
introductory tutorial</a>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we can <a href="https://tlverse.org/sl3/articles/custom_lrnrs.html">Define New <code>sl3</code>
Learners</a> which can be used
in all the places you could otherwise use any other <code>sl3</code> learners, including
<code>Pipelines</code>, <code>Stacks</code>, and the SL.</p>
<p>Recall that the discrete SL, or cross-validated selector, is a metalearner that
assigns a weight of 1 to the learner with the lowest cross-validated empirical
risk, and weight of 0 to all other learners. This metalearner specification can
be invoked with <code>Lrnr_cv_selector</code>.</p>

In the plot below, we visualize the steps for executing the Super Learner in
the `tlverse/delayed` framework. For those like myself who are not particularly
keen on understanding the intricacies of `delayed`, let's focus on the main
point of this figure: we can see there are 10 realizations of the stack which
represent the 10 cross-validation folds and there is a separate hold-out
(top branch of the figure) that will not be used to fit the Super Learner.

<p>We can cross-validate the SL to see how well the SL performs on unseen data, and
obtain an estimate of the cross-validated risk of the SL.</p>
<p>This estimation procedure requires an outer/external layer of
cross-validation, also called nested cross-validation, which involves setting
aside a separate holdout sample that we don’t use to fit the SL. This external
cross-validation procedure may also incorporate 10 folds, which is the default
in <code>sl3</code>. However, we will incorporate 2 outer/external folds of
cross-validation for computational efficiency.</p>
<p>We also need to specify a loss function to evaluate SL. Documentation for the
available loss functions can be found in the <a href="https://tlverse.org/sl3/reference/loss_functions.html"><code>sl3</code> Loss Function

<h2>Variable Importance Measures with <code>sl3</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#variable-importance-measures-with-sl3"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Variable importance can be interesting and informative. It can also be
contradictory and confusing. Nevertheless, we like it, and so do our
collaborators, so we created a variable importance function in <code>sl3</code>! The <code>sl3</code>
<code>importance</code> function returns a table with variables listed in decreasing order
of importance (i.e., most important on the first row).</p>
<p>The measure of importance in <code>sl3</code> is based on a risk ratio, or risk difference,
between the learner fit with a removed, or permuted, covariate and the learner
fit with the true covariate, across all covariates. In this manner, the larger
the risk difference, the more important the variable is in the prediction.</p>
<p>The intuition of this measure is that it calculates the risk (in terms of the
average loss in predictive accuracy) of losing one covariate, while keeping
everything else fixed, and compares it to the risk if the covariate was not
lost. If this risk ratio is one, or risk difference is zero, then losing that
covariate had no impact, and is thus not important by this measure. We do this
across all of the covariates. As stated above, we can remove the covariate and
refit the SL without it, or we just permute the covariate (faster)
and hope for the shuffling to distort any meaningful information that was
present in the covariate. This idea of permuting instead of removing saves a lot
of time, and is also incorporated in the <code>randomForest</code> variable importance
measures. However, the permutation approach is risky, so the importance function
default is to remove and refit.</p>
<p>Let’s explore the <code>sl3</code> variable importance measurements for the <code>washb</code> data.</p>

## Super Learning of a Conditional Density

### Super learning of a conditional density

Suppose we want to construct a Super Learner of the conditional probability
distribution $g_0(a\mid W)=P_0(A=a\mid W)$, where $a\in {\cal A}$.
Let's denote the values of $a$ with $\{0,1,\ldots,K\}$. A valid loss function
for the conditional density is
\[
L(g)(O)=-\log g(A\mid W).\]
That is, $g_0=\arg\min_g P_0L(g)$, i.e., $g_0$ is the minimizer of the
expectation of the log-likelihood loss.

**Candidate estimators**

1. Candidate estimators based on multinomial logistic regression: To start
with, one can use existing parametric model based MLE and machine learning
algorithms in `R` that fit a multinomial regression. For example, parametric
model multinomial logistic regression is available in `R` so that one can
already build a rich library of such estimators based on  different candidate
parametric models. In addition, `polyclass()` is a multinomial logistic
regression machine learning algorithm in `R`.

2. Candidate estimators based on machine learning for multinomial logistic
regression: Secondly, one can use a machine learning algorithm such as
`polyclass()` in `R` that data adaptively fits a multinomial logistic
regression, which itself has tuning parameters, again generating a class of
candidate estimators.

3. Incorporating screening: Note that one can also marry any of these choices
with a screening algorithm, thereby creating more candidate estimators of
interest. The screening can be particularly important when there are many
variables.

4. Candidate estimators by fitting separate logistic regressions and using
post-normalization

* Code $A$ in terms of Bernoullis $B_k=I(A=k)$, $k=0,\ldots,K$.
* Construct an estimator $\bar{g}_{nk}$ of $\bar{g}_{0k}(W)\equiv P_0(B_k=1\mid
  W)$ using any of the logistic regression algorithms, for all $k=0,\ldots,K$.
* This implies an estimator
\[
g_n(a\mid W)=\frac{\bar{g}_{na}(W)}{\sum_{k=0}^K \bar{g}_{nk}(W)}.\]
* In other words, we simply normalize these separate logistic regression
estimators so that we obtain a valid conditional distribution.
* This generates an enormous amount of interesting algorithms, since we have
available the whole machine learning literature for binary outcome regression.

5. Candidate estimators by estimating the conditional "hazard" with pooled
logistic regression.
Note that
\[
g_0(a\mid W)=\lambda_0(a\mid W) S_0(a\mid W),\]
where \[
\lambda_0(a\mid W)=P_0(A=a\mid A\geq a,W),\]

and $S_0(a\mid W)=\prod_{s\leq a}(1-\lambda_0(s\mid W))$ is the conditional
survival function $P_0(A>a\mid W)$. So we have now parameterized the
conditional distribution of $A$, given $W$, by a conditional hazard
$\lambda_0(a\mid W)$: $g_0=g_{\lambda_0}$.

* We could now focus on constructing candidate estimators of
$\lambda_0(a\mid W)$, which implies candidate estimators of $g_0$.

* For every observation $A_i$, we can create $A_i+1$ rows of data
$(W,s,I(A_i=s))$, $s=0,\ldots,A_i$, $i=1,\ldots,n$. We now run a logistic
regression estimator based on the pooled data set, ignoring ID, where we
regress the binary outcome $I(A_i=s)$ on the covariates $(W,s)$.

* If one assumes a parametric model, then this is nothing else then using the
maximum likelihood estimator, demonstrating that ignoring the ID is not
inefficient.

* This defines now an estimator of $\lambda_0(s\mid W)=P_0(A=s\mid W,A\geq s)$
as a function of $(s,W)$.

* Different choices of logistic regression based estimators will define
different estimators.

* The pooling across $s$ is not very sensible if $A$ is not an ordered variable
If $A$ is categorical, we recommend to compute  a separate logistic regression
estimator of $\lambda_0(a\mid W)$ for each $a$ (i.e., stratify by $s$ in the
  above pooled data set).

* For non-categorical $A$, one could include both stratified (by level) as well
as pooled (across levels) based logistic regression estimators.


## Exercise 2 -- Estimating the Propensity Score with `sl3` {#sl3ex-pscore}

exercise where we can look at positivity and maybe modify target population,
address issues related to this

## Super Learning of an Optimal Individualized Treatment Rule

* Data $O=(W,A,Y)$, and nonparametric model \mathcal{M} potentially containing
assumptions on the conditional probability distribution of $A$ given $W$
$g_0(A\mid W)$.
* Target: Optimal treatment rule $\psi_0(W)=I(B_0(W)>0)$, where
$B_0(W)=E_0(Y\mid A=1,W)-E_0(Y\mid A=0,W)$, the conditional treatment effect.
* Possible loss function for $\psi_0$ is an IPCW-loss:
\[
L_{g_0}(\psi)=\frac{I(A=\psi(W))}{g(A\mid W)}Y.\]

Indeed, $\psi_0$ is the minimizer of $EL_{g_0}(\psi)$ over all rules $\psi$.
* Construct library of candidate estimators of $\psi_0=I(B_0>0)$. This can
include estimators based on plugging in an estimator of $B_0$.
* One could also include a candidate estimator $I(B_n>0)$ where $B_n$ is a
Super Learner of $B_0$, e.g. based on loss function
\[
L_{g_0}(B)=\big(\frac{2A-1}{/g(A\mid W)}Y-B(W)\big)^2\]
that directly targets $B_0=\arg\min_B P_0L_{g_0}(B)$. This loss function is
still a squared error loss but its minimized by the true $B_0$.
* Estimate $g_0$ if not known.
* Compute cross-validation selector:
\[
k_n=\arg\min_k E_{B_n}P_{n,B_n}^1 L_{\hat{g}(P_{n,B_n}^0)}
(\hat{\Psi}_k(P_{n,B_n}^0)).\]
where $B_n = \{0,1\}^n$ is used for a binary vector of $n$ defining sample
splits, where the validation sample is ${i:B_n(i) = 1}$ and ${i:B_n(i) = 0}$ is
the training sample. The empirical distribution $P_{n,B_n}^0$ corresponds to
the split $B_n$ of the training sample and the empirical distribution of the
validation sample is $P_{n,B_n}^1$.
* Super-learner of optimal rule $\psi_0$: $\hat{\Psi}_{k_n}(P_n)$.

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Concluding Remarks<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#concluding-remarks"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Super Learner (SL) is a general approach that can be applied to a diversity of
estimation and prediction problems which can be defined by a loss function.</p></li>
<li>
<p>It would be straightforward to plug in the estimator returned by SL into the
target parameter mapping.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, suppose we are after the average treatment effect (ATE) of a
binary treatment intervention:
<span class="math inline">\(\Psi_0 = \mathbb{E}_{0,W}[\mathbb{E}_0(Y \mid A=1,W) -  \mathbb{E}_0(Y \mid A=0,W)]\)</span>.</li>
<li>We could use the SL that was trained on the original data (let’s call
this <code>sl_fit</code>) to predict the outcome for all subjects under each
intervention. All we would need to do is take the average difference
between the counterfactual outcomes under each intervention of interest.</li>
<li>Considering <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_0\)</span> above, we would first need two <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-length vectors of
predicted outcomes under each intervention. One vector would represent the
predicted outcomes under an intervention that sets all subjects to
receive <span class="math inline">\(A=1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Y_i \mid A_i=1,W_i\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots,n\)</span>. The other
vector would represent the predicted outcomes under an intervention that
sets all subjects to receive <span class="math inline">\(A=0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Y_i \mid A_i=0,W_i\)</span> for all
<span class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots,n\)</span>.</li>
<li>After obtaining these vectors of counterfactual predicted outcomes, all
we would need to do is average and then take the difference in order to
plug-in the SL estimator into the target parameter mapping.</li>
<li>In <code>sl3</code> and with our current ATE example, this could be achieved with
<code>mean(sl_fit$predict(A1_task)) - mean(sl_fit$predict(A0_task))</code>;
where <code>A1_task$data</code> would contain all 1’s (or the level that pertains to
receiving the treatment) for the treatment column in the data (keeping all
else the same), and <code>A0_task$data</code> would contain all 0’s (or the level
that pertains to not receiving the treatment) for the treatment column in
the data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>It’s a worthwhile exercise to obtain the predicted counterfactual outcomes
and create these counterfactual <code>sl3</code> tasks. It’s too biased; however, to
plug the SL fit into the target parameter mapping, (e.g., calling the result
of <code>mean(sl_fit$predict(A1_task)) - mean(sl_fit$predict(A0_task))</code> the
estimated ATE. We would end up with an estimator for the ATE that was
optimized for estimation of the prediction function, and not the ATE!</p></li>
<li>
<p>Ultimately, we want an estimator that is optimized for our target estimand of
interest. Here, we cared about doing a good job estimating the ATE. The
SL is an essential step to help us get there. In fact, we will use the
counterfactual predicted outcomes that were explained at length above.
However, SL might not be not the end of the estimation procedure.
Plugging in the Super Learner in the target parameter representation would
generally not result in an asymptotically linear estimator of the target
estimand. This begs the question, why is it important for an estimator to
possess these properties?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An asymptotically linear estimator converges to the estimand at
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\)</span> rate, thereby permitting formal statistical inference
(i.e., confidence intervals and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values).</p></li>
<li><p>Substitution, or plug-in, estimators of the estimand are desirable because
they respect both the local and global constraints of the statistical model
(e.g., bounds), and have they have better finite-sample properties.</p></li>
<li>
<p>An efficient estimator is optimal in the sense that it has the lowest
possible variance, and is thus the most precise. An estimator is efficient
if and only if is asymptotically linear with influence curve equal to the
canonical gradient.</p>
<ul>
<li>The canonical gradient is a mathematical object that is specific to
the target estimand, and it provides information on the level of
difficulty of the estimation problem. Various canonical gradient are
shown in the chapters that follow.</li>
<li>Practitioner’s do not need to know how to calculate a canonical
gradient in order to understand efficiency and use Targeted Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (TMLE). Metaphorically, you do not need to be
Yoda in order to be a Jedi.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>TMLE is a general strategy that succeeds in constructing efficient and
asymptotically linear plug-in estimators.</p></li>
<li><p>SL is fantastic for pure prediction, and for obtaining an initial
estimate in the first step of TMLE, but we need the second step of TMLE to
have the desirable statistical properties mentioned above.</p></li>
<li><p>In the chapters that follow, we focus on the Targeted Maximum Likelihood
Estimator and it’s generalization to Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimator,
both referred to as TMLE.</p></li>
</ul>
<!--
We could just plug-in the estimator returned by Super Learner; however, this is
problematic because the Super Learner estimators are trading off bias and
variance in an optimal way and as a result their bias is essentially the rate
of convergence of these algorithms, which is always slower than $1/\sqrt{n}$.
Therefore, if we plug-in the estimator returned by Super Learner into the
target parameter mapping, we would end up with an estimator which has the same
bias as what we plugged in, which is greater than $1/\sqrt{n}$. Thus, we end up
with an estimator which is not asymptotically normal, since it does not
converge to the estimand at $1/\sqrt{n}$ rate.

An asymptotically linear estimator has no meaningful bias ($ < 1/\sqrt{n}$),
and can be written as an empirical mean in first order of a function of the
data, the influence curve, plus some negligible remainder term. Once an
estimator is asymptotically linear with an influence curve it’s normally
distributed, so the standardized estimator converges to a normal distribution
with mean 0 and variance is the variance of the influence curve. Thus, it is
advantageous to construct asymptotically linear estimators since they permit
formal statistical inference. Among the class of regular asymptotically linear
estimators, there is an optimal estimator which is an efficient estimator, and
that’s the one with influence curve equal to the canonical gradient of the
path-wise derivative of the target parameter. The canonical gradient is the
direction of the path through the data distribution where the parameter is
steepest. An estimator is efficient if and only if is asymptotically linear
with influence curve equal to the canonical gradient. One can calculate the
canonical gradient with the statistical model and the statistical target
parameter.  Techniques for calculating the canonical gradient entail projecting
an initial gradient on the tangent space of the model at the particular
distribution in the model in which you want to calculate the canonical
gradient.

Now we know what it takes to construct an efficient estimator. Namely, we need
to construct an estimator which is asymptotically linear with influence curve
the canonical gradient. There are three general classes of estimators which
succeed in constructing asymptotically linear estimators: (1) the one-step
estimator, but it is not a plug-in estimator; (2) the targeted maximum
likelihood estimator, which is a Super Learner targeted towards the target
parameter and it is a plug-in estimator; and (3) estimating equation based
estimators, which use the canonical gradient but as an estimating function in
the target parameter. In the chapters that follow, we focus on the targeted
maximum likelihood estimator and the targeted minimum loss-based estimator,
both referred to as TMLE.
