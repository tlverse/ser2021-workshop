# Welcome! {-}

This open source, reproducible vignette is for a full-day workshop on the
Targeted Learning framework for statistical and causal inference with machine
learning, given at the [ENAR 2021 Spring
Meeting](https://www.enar.org/meetings/spring2021/) on Sunday, 14 March 2021.
Beyond introducing Targeted Learning, the workshop focuses on applying the
methodology in practice using the [`tlverse` software
ecosystem](https://github.com/tlverse).  These materials are based on a working
draft of the book [*Targeted Learning in `R`: Causal Data Science with the
`tlverse` Software Ecosystem*](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook/), which
includes in-depth discussion of these topics and much more, and may serve as a
useful reference to accompany these workshop materials.

## About this workshop {-}

This full-day workshop will provide a comprehensive introduction to the field of
_Targeted Learning_ and the corresponding [`tlverse` software
ecosystem](https://github.com/tlverse). In particular, we will focus on targeted
minimum loss estimators of causal effects, including those of static dynamic,
optimal dynamic, and stochastic interventions. These multiply robust, efficient
plug-in estimators use state-of-the-art, ensemble machine learning tools to
flexibly adjust for confounding while yielding valid statistical inference.

In addition to discussion, this workshop will incorporate both interactive
activities and hands-on, guided `R` programming exercises, to allow participants
the opportunity to familiarize themselves with methodology and tools that will
translate to real-world data analysis. It is highly recommended for participants
to have an understanding of basic statistical concepts such as confounding,
probability distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and
regression. Advanced knowledge of mathematical statistics is useful but not
necessary.  Familiarity with the `R` programming language will be essential.

## About the instructors {-}

### Mark van der Laan {-}

Mark van der Laan, PhD, is Professor of Biostatistics and Statistics at UC
Berkeley. His research interests include statistical methods in computational
biology, survival analysis, censored data, adaptive designs, targeted maximum
likelihood estimation, causal inference, data-adaptive loss-based learning, and
multiple testing. His research group developed loss-based super learning in
semiparametric models, based on cross-validation, as a generic optimal tool for
the estimation of infinite-dimensional parameters, such as nonparametric density
estimation and prediction with both censored and uncensored data. Building on
this work, his research group developed targeted maximum likelihood estimation
for a target parameter of the data-generating distribution in arbitrary
semiparametric and nonparametric models, as a generic optimal methodology for
statistical and causal inference. Most recently, Mark's group has focused in
part on the development of a centralized, principled set of software tools for
targeted learning, the `tlverse`.

### Alan Hubbard {-}

Alan Hubbard is Professor of Biostatistics, former head of the Division of
Biostatistics at UC Berkeley, and head of data analytics core at UC Berkeley's
SuperFund research program. His current research interests include causal
inference, variable importance analysis, statistical machine learning,
estimation of and inference for data-adaptive statistical target parameters, and
targeted minimum loss-based estimation. Research in his group is generally
motivated by applications to problems in computational biology, epidemiology,
and precision medicine.

## Reproduciblity with the `tlverse` {#repro}

The `tlverse` software ecosystem is a growing collection of packages, several of
which are quite early on in the software lifecycle. The team does its best to
maintain backwards compatibility. Once this work reaches completion, the
specific versions of the `tlverse` packages used will be archived and tagged to
produce it.

This book was written using [bookdown](http://bookdown.org/), and the complete
source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tlverse/tlverse-handbook).
This version of the book was built with `r R.version.string`,
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) version `r rmarkdown::pandoc_version()`, and the
following packages:

```{r pkg-list, echo = FALSE, results="asis"}
# borrowed from https://github.com/tidymodels/TMwR/blob/master/index.Rmd
deps <- desc::desc_get_deps()
pkgs <- sort(deps$package[deps$type == "Imports"])
pkgs <- sessioninfo::package_info(pkgs, dependencies = FALSE)
df <- tibble::tibble(
  package = pkgs$package,
  version = pkgs$ondiskversion,
  source = gsub("@", "\\\\@", pkgs$source)
)
knitr::kable(df, format = "markdown")
```

## Setup instructions {#setup}

### R and RStudio

**R** and **RStudio** are separate downloads and installations. R is the
underlying statistical computing environment. RStudio is a graphical integrated
development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more
interactive. You need to install R before you install RStudio.

#### Windows

##### If you already have R and RStudio installed

* Open RStudio, and click on "Help" > "Check for updates". If a new version is
  available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.
* To check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing
  that appears in the console indicates the version of R you are
  running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display
  which version of R you are running. Go on the [CRAN
  website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and check whether a
  more recent version is available. If so, please download and install it. You
  can [check here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f)
  for more information on how to remove old versions from your system if you
  wish to do so.

##### If you don't have R and RStudio installed

* Download R from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
* Run the `.exe` file that was just downloaded
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows
  XP/Vista/7/8** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
* Double click the file to install it
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.

#### macOS / Mac OS X

##### If you already have R and RStudio installed

* Open RStudio, and click on "Help" > "Check for updates". If a new version is
  available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.
* To check the version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing
  that appears on the terminal indicates the version of R you are running.
  Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display which
  version of R you are running. Go on the [CRAN
  website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and check whether a more
  recent version is available. If so, please download and install it.

##### If you don't have R and RStudio installed

* Download R from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx).
* Select the `.pkg` file for the latest R version
* Double click on the downloaded file to install R
* It is also a good idea to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) (needed
  by some packages)
* Go to the [RStudio download
  page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)**
  (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
* Double click the file to install RStudio
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.

#### Linux

* Follow the instructions for your distribution
  from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux), they provide information
  to get the most recent version of R for common distributions. For most
  distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run
  `sudo apt-get install r-base`, and for Fedora `sudo yum install R`), but we
  don't recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are
  usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least R 3.3.1.
* Go to the [RStudio download
  page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select the version that matches your distribution, and
  install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu `sudo dpkg -i
  rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb` at the terminal).
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.

for Data Analysis and Visualization of Ecological
Data](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/).
